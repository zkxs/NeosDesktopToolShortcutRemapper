# NeosDesktopToolShortcutRemapper

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that remaps `5` on desktop from ShapeTip to ComponentCloneTip.

Relevant Neos issue: [#2412](https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/2412).

This is currently not configurable, but it wouldn't be difficult to load settings from some sort of config file in the future.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [NeosDesktopToolShortcutRemapper.dll](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosDesktopToolShortcutRemapper/releases/latest/download/NeosDesktopToolShortcutRemapper.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
